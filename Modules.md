**Modules** are pieces of code that we can borrow in Python
This includes things like **functions**


> For example, in `ramdom` we used the `.choice()` function
> to choose something randomly from a l[[lists]]

These pieces of code are **not** automatically included,
so we need to `import` them into our code explicitly


# `import`
The `import` keyword loads the module into our Python file
**`import` should be at the hop of our file, under the header**
# The `time` module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
Specifically, we can use `time` to pause our code

```python
import time

# Pause our code for 1 second
time.sleep(1)
```
