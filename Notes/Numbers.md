# Numbers

## Integer

Integers are negative or positive whole numbers.

In Python they have the type `int`.

Examples:

```python
my_age = 16
population_of_lower_mainland = 3_000_000
```
## Floating Point Number

Floating point numbers are positive or negative
numbers with a decimal place in them.

In Python they have the type `float`.

```python
AVOGADROS_NUMBER = 0.0000000000000000000000602
PI = 3.14159
```

If you're ever wondering what type something is, you can
use the `type()` function. It will tell you what type of data
some value has.

## Recommendation Systems

#### Popularity and "Likes"

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on
how many people "like" the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in
Instagram. When you click on that heart button, Instagram 
records it somewhere along with other data like demographic
and psychographic information. With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and services that you like.

We implemented the Popularity/Likes paradigm with our
Favourite Bubble Tea activity

## N-Point Rating System

N-Point rating system are used by many services
particularly Jeff Bezo's baby, Amazon


This paradigm provides more granular information.
Buyers are asked to rate the product on a 5-point scale.
All the ratings are put together and an aggregate score is given
out of five stars
