a function is a block of code that can be reused over and over again.

We can input data to the function. We can refer to the data as **parameters**.

We use the term **arguments** to describe the ACTUAL data that we put
into the function,

```python
def area_of_a_square(sidelength: float):
	""""Calculates the area of a square.
	Results are in units squared.
	
	Params:
	
	sidelength - length of one side of the square"""
	
	area = sidelength ** 2
	
	print(f"The area of a square with side length = {sidelength})
	is: {area} square units"")

area_of_square(12.2). # 12.2 is the argument
```
