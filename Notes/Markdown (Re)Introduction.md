# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#)
We can also create different "level" headings
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## This is a subheading level 2

### This is a level 3 subheading

###### Level 6 is the smallest

# Modifying Text Style

We can use asterisks (\*)to modify text style, specifically 
bold and italics
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this *word to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized
***This whole sentence is emphasized***

## Aside: Escape Characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY
a **keyword** or **reserved character** we use the back
slash (\\)

# Strikethrough
We can strike through characters or words using the
tilde (~)
e.g.
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell ~~neighbor~~ neighbour 
~~This whole sentence is a mistake~~

# Links
Links allow us to reference information externally 
[A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
- If you have an open ai account
	- ask chatgpt to make you two links to 
	 whatever website using markdown
	 at the end of the links, put down "*from chatgpt"
- If you don't
	- create two more links to some other website you think is useful
e.g.
[Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip3dKC3JuBAxV8ETQIHc4UBE4QPAgJ) chatgpt

the links

[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/)
[Github](https://www.github.com/)

s/o to *chatgpt for the links

# Blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bugger chunk of text.
We use carets(>) to create blockquotes

e.g.

>This is an example of a *blockquote*
>This is line two of a *blockquote*
>
>This is line four of the blockquote; the third is blank

# Links
We can create both unordered and ordered lists

## Unordered lists
To create each point, we use asterisks (\*) with a space behind it
We can create a sub portion of the list by placing TABS
before the asterisk

e.g.






## Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list,
we can create an ordered list
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.

1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to create a second line*)
   Both brown and granulated sugar should be added
3. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown.
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

e.g.

|  Name        |  Age        |  Sign       |  Superpower       |
|  ---         | ---         | ---     | --- |
| Sommerson | 23 | Basketball | Tall |
