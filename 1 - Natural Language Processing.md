# Output
We can display text and symbols using output

We use the print() function to display output

```python
print()
```





# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *NOT* interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored
We use the # symbol to make comments

# [[Headers]]

# Input
We grab information from the user using input()
It will wait for the user to type something in **and** press Enter/Return


# Variables
Variables allow us to **store** information for the time our app
is running.

```python
favourite_food = input("What is you rfavourite food?")
```


favourite_food -> name of the variable
= -> **assignment** operator
input... -> value



# [[Strings]]
