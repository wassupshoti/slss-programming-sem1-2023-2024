# Output
We can display text and symbols using output

We use the print() function to display output

```python
print()
```


# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *NOT* interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored
We use the # symbol to make comments

# [[Headers]]

# Input
We grab information from the user using input()
It will wait for the user to type something in **and** press Enter/Return


# Variables
Variables allow us to **store** information for the time our app
is running.

```python
favourite_food = input("What is you rfavourite food?")
```


favourite_food -> name of the variable
= -> **assignment** operator
input... -> value



# [[Strings]]


# [[Design]]

# [[Lists]]

In Python, lists are a collection of items
We store values inside of lists
The values of the items can be of different [[Types]]
**Orders matters** in a list

# Creating a List
To make a list, we use brackets \[\] to surround our list
We separate the individual items with commas
```python
some_list = ["Jimmy", "Sara", "Frederique"]
```

# Access Elements in the List
We can access the individual things from lists using **bracket notation**
In the example below, we'll use bracket notation to access "Sara"

```python
some_list[1]              # "Sara"  
some_list[0]              # "Jimmy"
some_list[2]              # "Frederique"
some_list[-1]             # "Frederique" counts from the end
some_list[-2]             # "Sara"
```

Inside the brackets, we give the *index* of the item we want
Python uses **0-index** counting, which means we start counting at 0
